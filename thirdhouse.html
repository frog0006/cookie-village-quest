             About us!

             We are a group based in Rockville, MD and are currently sophomores at Thomas Wootton and Poolesville High School.
             All of us designed the game graphics by hand and were inspired by the untraditional style of Ascii art!
             We hope you enjoy Cookie Village as much as we enjoyed creating it! :>
             
             Background:
             This cookie village game story goes...

            “Once upon a time, hundreds of years ago, cookie tribes in the land of the Cookie Village lived in peace and harmony. “
            One day, the Cookie Village began to be attacked by evil cockroaches that sought cookie crumbs. As a result, chaos 
            ensued as the cockroaches raided cookie homes and ripped them apart limb by limb. The cookie people had to flee their 
            land and never came back since… Now, in the present day, a hero (you) arrives in Cookie Village and recognizes the disaster 
            that struck centuries ago. The hero knows what must be done. 
            Taking vengeance on the cockroach-infested land is going to be a challenge on this quest.
